# cooltexts

A collection of communist and anarchist texts which i think are cool.

Originally a mirror of [redtexts](https://github.com/redtexts/mirror-tools), but
there is a almost nothing remaining from the original scripts infrastructure.

If you have any questions, just open up an issue or shoot me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/problemicist).

## Contribution

All the texts are contained within `static/sources` directories (with their
respective covers in `static/covers`), so you can easily add a text you've formatted.

The list with all the books is in the `content/prints.json`.
