## Known errors

This is *not* an exhaustive list of errors and mistakes that I know about just so
you are aware before committing to buying/printing these books out. In general, keep in mind
that I am doing all of this myself and this is not a
professional/official thing, there might be a few mistakes and omissions I didn't catch.

* **Tiqqun Vol. 1 is currently under heavy revision!**
* Index numbers in "Marx, Marginalism and Modern Sociology" are a little bit fucked up!
* Theorie Communiste Reader contains all of their writing that's translated into English, except
for their critique of the Friends of Classless Society '28 Theses' available [here](http://endnotes.org.uk/file_hosting/28-thesis-on-class-society-a-critical-commentary.pdf). I just missed it, sorry!
UPD: 17 Theses from TC13 have also been translated, available [here](https://endnotes.org.uk/other_texts/en/bernard-leon-alain-in-memoriam-b-l).
* The Society of the Spectacle is missing the later prefaces added by Debord.

## About

An archive of cool communist and anarchist texts. This website runs on
Github Pages and Zola, more up-to-date info is available on the 
[Github page](https://github.com/cooltexts/cooltexts.github.io/).

You are welcome to contribute to this project in any way:
either directly on Github, or through me.
I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solutionicist)
if you have any questions, suggestions or corrections!

I am looking to expand the library presented here, so if you have anything 
you want to get a nice print of (preferrably books that are long out
of print or have never been printed properly), shoot me a DM on Twitter or
on Discord: `solutionicist#5379`.

## Stuff in progress

I am currently transcribing and formatting a few books:
* The Veritable Split in the International
* Pashukanis Selected Writings

## Last updates

* Updated the *TC Reader* and the *Aufheben Decadence Series* books. They're now a little nicer and shorter (and cheaper!!!)

* November '21
    * Added Simon Clarke's Keynesianism book!
